TCS3200
For the first time, you need to open the TCS3200 file to obtain the color code (Here I'm using Green, Blue, Red).

Color Sensor
You can input the color code you obtained into the Color Sensor. This file contains Arduino code to detect colors.

Sorting Device
The latest version of the Color Sensor where the color sensor is combined with a servo to move items in the desired direction according to the detected color. doorServo is the command to open the servo door.
